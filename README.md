# python-challenge
This challenge involves using Python scripting to analyze financial data (budget_data.csv: "Date" and "Profit/Losses") and modernize vote counting for a small town (election_data.csv: "Voter ID," "County," "Candidate").

This repository contains two folders: PyBank and PyPoll. Each folder has subfolders named Analysis and Resources, along with a main.py file for running the analysis. The Resources folder holds the CSV files used on the project. The Analysis folder contains text files with analysis results and terminal screenshots. Additionally, you can access the same files via this Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TiJeXteBsuBjUPt3LAO39n759ie8T_vf?usp=sharing.
